# LinkedIn Clone (Flutter)

This is a functional LinkedIn clone built with Flutter. The project demonstrates a modular approach to building a social network app, focusing on core features and functionality rather than style.

## Screenshots

| Login Screen | Feed | Profile |
|:------------:|:----:|:-------:|
| ![Login](lib/screenshots/ScreenshotLogin.png) | ![Feed](lib/screenshots/ScreenshotFeed.png) | ![Messages](lib/screenshots/ScreenshotMessages.png) |

## Features
- **Authentication:** Login and registration forms. Only a hardcoded user can log in.
- **Feed:** View a list of hardcoded news posts. Users can like posts.
- **Profile:** View a hardcoded user profile (Adilkhan Orakbay).
- **Connections:** See a list of hardcoded connections.
- **Messages:** View a list of hardcoded messages.
- **Notifications:** View a list of hardcoded notifications.


## How to Login
- Use the following credentials to log in:
  - **Email:** `aa@gmail.com`
  - **Password:** `1234`
- Any other credentials will not work.

## Project Structure
- `lib/models/` — Data models (User, Post, etc.)
- `lib/services/` — Business logic and data services
- `lib/screens/` — UI screens for each feature
- `lib/widgets/` — Reusable UI components

## Notes
- All data (posts, messages, connections, notifications) is hardcoded for demonstration purposes.
- The UI is kept simple to focus on functionality and structure.
